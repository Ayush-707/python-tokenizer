# Token Healing Script

The Token Healing script is a Python script that performs tokenization, spell checking, grammar correction, and correction of missing or extra words in a given text. It utilizes various libraries and models to enhance the quality and accuracy of the corrections.

## Dependencies

To run the script, the following dependencies need to be installed:

- NLTK: `pip install nltk`
- PySpellChecker: `pip install pyspellchecker`
- Gingerit: `pip install gingerit`
- Transformers: `pip install transformers`
- PyTorch: `pip install torch`

## Algorithm Steps

The Token Healing script follows these steps to correct the given text:

1. **Tokenization**: The text is tokenized into individual words using the NLTK library's `word_tokenize` function.

2. **Spell Checking**: Each token is checked for spelling errors using the PySpellChecker library's `SpellChecker` class. Incorrectly spelled tokens are replaced with their most probable correct spelling.

3. **Grammar Correction**: The text is analyzed using the Gingerit library's `GingerIt` class, which performs grammar correction and suggests improvements. The corrected text is obtained by replacing the identified grammar errors with the suggested corrections.

4. **Missing or Extra Words**: The text is processed using the GPT-2 language model provided by the Transformers library. The model generates a continuation of the given text, and the same number of sentences as in the original text are extracted from the generated continuation. These extracted sentences form the corrected text, addressing missing or extra words.

## Usage

To use the Token Healing script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies mentioned in the "Dependencies" section are installed.

2. Copy the script to a Python file (e.g., `token_healing.py`) in your project directory.

3. In the command line, navigate to your project directory and run the script using the command: `python token_healing.py`

4. Enter the text you want to correct. The script will display the original text and the corrected text.

5. To exit the program, enter "exit" when prompted for input.

**Note:** The script assumes that each sentence ends with a punctuation mark (".", "?", "!"). If the input text does not end with a punctuation mark, the script will add a period to the text before processing it.
